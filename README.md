# Full-Stack Digital Wallet - Technical Assessment

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React or Angular with TypeScript
- **Backend**: C# (.NET Core)
- **Database**: Any relational database

---

## Task
Create a **digital wallet application** where users can:
1. Register and log in.
2. View their wallet balance.
3. Send money to other users.
4. View their transaction history.

---

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Use **TypeScript**.
- Implement **form validation** for user inputs.
- Show **real-time balance updates** after transactions.
- Display a list of **transaction history**.
- Handle **loading and error states** gracefully.

### Backend
- Build a **RESTful API** using **C# (.NET Core)**.
- Implement **basic authentication** for user login.
- Use **database transactions** to ensure data consistency.
- Return **proper HTTP status codes** for API responses.

### Database
- Design a **relational schema** for users, wallets, and transactions.
- Ensure **data consistency** (e.g., prevent negative balances, handle concurrent transactions).

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Code Quality (40%)**:
   - Clean, readable, and maintainable code.
   - Proper use of OOP principles.
2. **UI/UX Design (30%)**:
   - Intuitive and responsive user interface.
   - Good user experience (e.g., real-time updates, error handling).
3. **API Design (30%)**:
   - Well-defined RESTful endpoints.

---

## Submission
- **Source code (GITHUB LINK)** send an email to tech@hobbiton.co.zm for both frontend and backend.
- **Setup instructions** to run the application locally.

---

## Time Limit
- **1 week** to complete the assignment.

---

## Notes
- Keep the implementation **simple** and focused on core features.
- Prioritize **code quality** over adding unnecessary features.
- Document your **database choice** and design decisions.

---

This assignment tests your ability to build a **full-stack application** while focusing on **code quality, API design, database consistency, and user experience**. Good luck!
